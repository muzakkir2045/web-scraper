## ðŸ§  What I Learned

For this project, I first learned how to use the `requests` module to fetch HTML content from websites and then used `BeautifulSoup` to parse and extract specific elements from the page.

This helped me understand:

- How web pages are structured with HTML
- How to extract useful content like headlines using Python
- The difference between HTTP methods and error handling
- Real-world use of Python for automation and data scraping
